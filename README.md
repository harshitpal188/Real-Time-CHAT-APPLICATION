# Description of project

üí¨ Real-Time Chat Application
The Real-Time Chat App is a full-stack web application that enables users to send and receive messages instantly using WebSockets. Built with React on the frontend and Socket.IO on the backend (Node.js + Express), this chat app allows multiple users to join a shared chat room and communicate in real time. It‚Äôs a great demonstration of how to build a responsive, dynamic, and event-driven web app using modern JavaScript technologies.

This project showcases how real-time communication works between clients and servers without needing to refresh the page or rely on HTTP polling. It's ideal for learning concepts related to WebSocket protocols, event-based programming, state management in React, and efficient backend message handling.

üöÄ Features
Real-Time Messaging: Messages are sent and received instantly using Socket.IO‚Äôs WebSocket-based communication.

Join Chat Room: Users can join a common chat room by entering a username.

User Notifications: When users join or leave, notifications are broadcast to other participants.

Responsive Design: Fully mobile-friendly layout built with React and styled using CSS (or Tailwind, if used).

Server-Client Architecture: Separate backend and frontend folders for clean architecture and maintainability.

Auto-Scroll: The chat window automatically scrolls to the newest message.

Connection Management: Displays notifications when users connect or disconnect.

Simple UI/UX: Clean and minimal interface to keep the focus on chat functionality.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend (React)
React.js: For building the interactive UI.

Socket.IO Client: For real-time communication with the backend.

React Hooks: For managing component state and lifecycle.

CSS3 or Tailwind CSS: For responsive and modern UI design.
